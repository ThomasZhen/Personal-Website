<!-- <p>I am currently a software engineer at eBay Inc. I obtained a B.A. degree in Computer Science and a B.A. degree in Applied Math from the University of California, Berkeley. During my undergraduate, I have done four semesters of research on vision-correcting display under the supervision of <a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/brian-barsky">Prof. Brian Barsky</a>.</p> -->
<h2>Why I major computer science</h2>
<p>I started to use comptuer when I was in thrid grade. I like using computer because it provides me access to a lot of information on the Internet. I like problem solving, and I like to make algorithm run faster. Other facters that contributes to my decision making is my living location. I live in San Francisco, and it is located in the Scilicon Valley. Therefore, majoring in computer sicenece is a right decision for me.</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
I value education. Not every one has equal access to education. As a first generation college student, I lack the mentorship from my parents. Funtunately, I met a lot of supportive people through out my college, and thankfully went to a good school.
<p> </p>
<h2>My Favorite Motto</h2>
<p>The pain you feel today is the strength you will feel tomorrow. For every challenge encountered there is opportunity for growth.</p> 

<h2>My Lovely Community College: City College of San Francisco</h2>

<h2>Basketball and NBA</h2>
I enjoy playing basketball and watching NBA. My favorite NBA team is obviously my local team, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>, and my favorite NBA player is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson">Klay Thompson</a>, who demonstrates great athleticism and more importantly good sportsmanship. Unlike other great NBA stars, he is rarely involved in NBA fights or pretentious celebrations on made field goals. Here are some of my favorite NBA clips.
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nyBpt9tRsg">Klay Thompson 37pt 3rd Quarter 1-23-15</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz29FUCJWWc">Epic Game between Warriors and Thunder</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxG-XCSQ4vk">2017 Finals Warriors vs Cavaliers Game 3 Last two minutes</a></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fishing and Crabbing</h2>
Other than basketball, I often go fishing and crabbing around the bay area. Here are some tips and regulations on fishing and crabbing. 
<ul>
  <li>use fishy salmon and chicken as bait</li>
  <li>go on a sunny day</li>
  <li>choose a spot with little water current</li>
